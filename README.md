# Recursive-folder-listing
A C ++ code that loops recursively through a folder tree and list files with their size in bytes using the old Windows API. The main attraction is the implementation uses the extremely important programming idiom called Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII).
Newer libraries like The Filesystem library do exist in C++, but I like retro programming.
